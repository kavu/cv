\section{Personal statement}
{\normalsize\parindent=1cm
  \begin{adjustwidth}{\hintscolumnwidth+\separatorcolumnwidth}{}
    I am passionate about gaining new knowledge. I love to learn. As a programmer, I am passionate about bleeding-edge technologies, learning them and solving hard tasks with them.

    In the very beginning of my career, while all my colleagues were programming in PHP, I started to learn and develop in Ruby. Later, Ruby became my primary programming language. Doing my Ruby projects on a regular basis, I began to learn something new besides Ruby. That is how I found Functional Programming~---~Erlang, Haskell, and Common Lisp. Then were Scala and Clojure. The list could go on.

    I am trying to experiment with every single technology I have a chance to work with. Coding in Scala for Android with working ProGuard obfuscation? Sure! Compiling a working OS X Application with a Go binary with Cocoa bindings? Let's make it possible. Exciting research tasks are the best tasks for me. However, I am trying to stay reasonable, to have an open mind~---~there is no ``silver'' bullet, every tool has its task and vice versa.

    Currently, I am excited about Google's Go programming language. It hooked me with its simplicity and speed. I have incredible experience building a RESTful API with it. But, to be honest, I do not think it is a good language for building a sophisticated full-featured web-site. I have made several libraries in Go for my use and learning purposes. One of them is fairly popular~---~\underline{\href{https://github.com/kavu/go\_reuseport}{\itshape go\_reuseport}}. It is a library for creating a Unix Socket network listener with the SO\_REUSEPORT option enabled. There is also one small and very special web-service made entirely in Go~---~\underline{\href{http://xamleeg.kavu.ru/}{\itshape Xamleeg}}.

    As a person who needs to visualize anything to understand it better, I am engaged different user-facing technologies. Currently, after leading a startup's development team for a year and a half and gaining much experience in mobile development, I am solely developing my simple boardgame-themed iOS utility in Swift. Later, I have plans to reimplement it as a Progressive Web App too. Also, my Xamleeg project has been in need of beeing updated for a long time.

    Apart from my desire to learn, I am eager to help people, to teach them, share my experience and provide my opinion, if needed. During my university years, I assisted my professor in conducting practical seminars. I was willing to stay as a teacher after graduating from the university, but due to budget cuts, our department could not offer me any position at that moment.

    So, now I am looking for a job where I can learn from people that are smarter than me, try new technologies and languages with them, build new great things together and share my experience with people afterward.

  \textbf{Responsibilities:}\\
  {\parindent=1cm
    After pivoting of Excursiopedia (see below) to mobile app project PlanetPass, I kept leading the Development Department as a Head of Development. My team size was fluctuating, but at maximum, we had 11 people, including myself~---~2 iOS developers, 2 Android developers, 2 DevOps and 5 server-side~/~web developers. I managed tasks' pipelines and their execution, coordinating developers with other teams and solving tech and organization difficulties.

    PlanetPass developed in Ruby, using Ruby~on~Rails framework, utilizing service oriented architecture, as it has several separate services, like API, promo web app, two content management systems and several job worker services. DevOps team developed the flexible Docker-based system over AWS cloud with Ansible provisioning, Terraform management and custom monitoring system written in Go, Ruby and using Grafana, Prometheus and InfluxDB. Android developers used fairly common development principles, but some parts of the apps are implemented in Kotlin. iOS Apps are developed in VIPER manner, in Swift, with Realm as a database engine. Release management was semi-automated: for server apps, it was done with Drone as CI and Ansible as a deployment tool, it was the primary responsibility of DevOps Team and Server Team Leader; mobile apps released were managed with Fastlane, and submitting new versions was my duty.

    My primary management responsibilities consisted of interaction with other C-Level (CEO, CMO, CFO, Head of Product, Head of Content) managers and solving various operational tasks and problems. We were developing product vision and development roadmaps, arranging deadlines, milestones, and priorities. Along with it, I had a monthly task to form and approve a Development budget, including all IT-services of our company, HR budget for present and future team members, laptops and other devices, IT demands which may be used by other teams.
