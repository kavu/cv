\section{Personal statement}
\cvline{}{\parindent=0.7cm
    I am passionate about gaining new knowledge. I love to learn. As a programmer, I am passionate about bleeding-edge technologies, learning them and solving hard tasks with them.

    Apart from my desire to learn, I am eager to help people, to teach them, share my experience and provide my opinion, if needed. During my university years, I assisted my professor in conducting practical seminars. I was willing to stay as a teacher after graduating from the university, but due to budget cuts, our department could not offer me any position at that moment.

    So, now I am looking for a job where I can learn from people that are smarter than me, try new technologies and languages with them, build new great things together and share my experience with people afterward.

  \textbf{Description:}\\
  {\parindent=1cm
    I worked at Teleport Future Technologies on full-time contract terms for 2.5 months. I created and managed the cloud infrastructure on Amazon Web Services via Terraform. Implemented the server API in Python (using S3, ElastiCache), which is serving machine learning model and deployed it via Docker containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service. Optimized the cloud and cloud management tools for expected high bandwidth. I began prototyping the first Proof of Concept of the API in C++ and Go. I created a demo page in vanilla JavaScript, using WebRTC and existing server API.
